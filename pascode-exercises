// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

a / 2 = c 
ask for number 
divide number by 2 
if quotient is a whole number print the number is even  
if quotient is a non-intger print number is odd  

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


a) n1,n2,n3,n4,n5 

b) make avrage (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 = average 
write average 

c) if n1<n2 set max n2 else 
set max to n1 
if n3>max set max to n3 
if n4>max set max to n4
if n5>max set max to n5 
print min 

if n1>n2 set min n2 else 
set min to n1 
if n3<min set min n3
if n4<min set min n4
if n5<min set min n5 
print min
